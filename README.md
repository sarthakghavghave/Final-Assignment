Software Lab-III Final Assignment
I have created a flask_app showing a home page of "Hello, World!" and procceding to form of accepting name and age. After submitting it will display a greeting according to the input values.

And django_app is created similar to ecommerce sites as it adds items selected from the list and creats a list of selected items with there price. Also I've added a feature to remove a specific item by clicking the delete button infront of that item in the list.

Docker_Compose.yml is used to make containers of both apps simultaneously and run on different servers.
